## Integrating with VSCode

You can get Solidity support for Visual Studio Code by installing [the VSCode Solidity extension](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity).

To make the extension play nice with Foundry, you will need to place your remappings in `remappings.txt`. If they are already in `foundry.toml`, copy them over and use `remappings.txt` instead. If you just use the autogenerated remappings that Foundry provides, run `forge remappings > remappings.txt`.

If you use a non-standard project layout, you may have to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "src",
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "lib"
}
```

Where `src` is the source code directory and `lib` is your dependency directory.

It is also recommended to specify a Solidity compiler version:

```json
"solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.10"
```

To get Foundry in line with the chosen version, add the following to your `default` profile in `foundry.toml`.

```toml
solc_version = "0.8.10"
```

### Example of using OpenZeppelin contracts and non-standard project layout.

```
.
└── project
    └── contracts
        ├── lib
        │   ├── forge-std
        │   └── openzeppelin-contracts
        ├── script
        ├── src
        └── test
```

Add line to `remappings.txt` file ([`forge remapping`](../projects/dependencies.md#remapping-dependencies)):

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

Add line to `.vscode/settings.json` file (solidity extension settings):

```json
{
  "solidity.remappings": [
    "@openzeppelin/=project/contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/"
  ]
}
```

Now all contracts from the OpenZeppelin documentation can be used.

```javascript
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```
